# last.fm crawler

Intention of thic project is to create Python crawler which will scrape all historic records into CSV file:
- Artist
- Title
- Timestamp

In the next step once crawler is working, I'd like to add next level crawler to enter each song's website to scrape:
- Album
- Length
- Tags

Working with:
